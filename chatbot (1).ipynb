The salient features of \\nthe constitution are as follows: - \\n\\uf0b7 Lengthiest written Constitution  \\n\\uf0b7 Blend of Rigidity and Flexibility  \\n\\uf0b7 Federal system with unitary features  \\n\\uf0b7 Parliamentary form of Government  \\n\\uf0b7 Independent judiciary  \\n\\uf0b7 Single citizenship  \\n\\uf0b7 Emergency provision  \\nStructure: - The Indian Constitution originally consisted of 395 Art, 22 parts, 8 Schedules.  But \\nafter the Constitution 104th  Amendment Act, 2003, the Indian Con stitution Consists of 44 8 \\nArt, 2 5 parts, 12 Schedules.  \\nPreamble: - The preamble to the constitution is based on the “ objective resolution”  drafted and \\nmoved by Pandit Nehru and adopted by constituent assembly. It runs as follows: - \\n“We  THE PEOPLE OF INDIA,  having solemnly resolved to co nstitute India in to a SOVERIGN \\nSOCIALIST  SECULAR  DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizen: - \\n\\uf0b7 JUSTICE, social, Economic, and Political;  \\n\\uf0b7 LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;  \\n\\uf0b7 EQUALITY of status and of opportunity ;, \\n\\uf0b7 FRATERNITY  assuring  the dignity  of the individual  and the unity  and integrity  of the \\nnation;  In our Constituent  Assembly,  this 26th  November,  1949 , do hereby  adopt,  enact  \\nand give to ourselves  this constitution. ” \\nPurpose of the Preamble: - The preamble to the constitution is a key to open the minds of \\nthe makers and shows the general purpose for which they made the several provisions in \\nthe constitution. Preamble serves the following purposes: - \\n1. It discloses the source of the const itution . \\n2. It lays down the  date of the commencement of the constitution.  \\n3. It set out the rights and freedoms which the people of India wished to secure for \\nthemselves.  \\n4. It declares the nature of the government.  \\n \\nQ1:- Whether Preamble is the part of the const itution?  \\nAns.: - In the case of Kesvanand Bharti vs. State of Kerala , the supreme  has held that \\npreamble is part of the constitution. Preamble is of extreme importance and the \\nconstitution should be read and interpreted in the light of grand and noble vision \\nexpressed in the preamble. However, two things should be noted: - \\n\\uf0d8 The preamble is neither a source of power to legislature nor prohibition upon the \\npowers of legislature.  \\n\\uf0d8    It is not justiciable  i.e. not enforceable in courts of law.  \\n ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The Preamble has been \\namended only once by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment act, which has added three new \\nwords - Socialistic, Secular and Integrity - to the  preamble.  \\n \\n \\nNature of Indian Constitution: -The Constitution is of two kinds: - \\n1. Unitary :- In a Unitary Constitutions the powers of the  Government are centralized in \\none  \\nGovernment v.z. the States or Provinces  are Subordinates to the Centre.  \\n2. Federal :- In Federal Constitution, there is a division of Powers between the federal and \\nthe  \\nState Government and both are independent in their own spheres. The American \\nConstitution is universally regarded as an example of the Federal Constitution.  \\n \\nCharacteristics of a federal Constitution: -  \\n \\n1. A Written Constitution  :-  For a federal Constitution it is Mandatory that there should be \\na written Constitution.  \\n2. Dual Government :- In case of federal constitution, there is system of dual government \\none at centre  and another at state.  \\n3. Supremacy of Constitutions :- For a federal Constitution there should be supremacy of \\nthe Constitution. At the time of the exercise of power by three organs of the Govt. i.e. \\nlegislative, executive and Judiciary, all functions are Sub ordinated and Controlled by the \\nConstitution.  \\n4. Distribution of Powers: - Federalism means the distribution of powers of the State \\namong a Number of Co -ordinate bodies each originating in and controlled by the \\nConstitution  \\n5. Rigidity: - Rigidity is one of the Ba sic essential of a federal Constitution. It highly depends \\non the Process of amendment.  \\n6. Independent Judiciary :- There should be an independent judiciary having authority on \\nother organs. In a federal Constitution the courts (judiciary) has the final power  to \\ninterpret the Constitution. Finally it should say that the judiciary is the Guardian of the \\nConstitution.  \\n  Conclusion  : Finally if can be said that the Indian Constitution  is neither Purely federal   nor \\npurely unitary  but a Unique Combination of Both  aspects.  \\n \\nPeculiar feature of Indian Constitution: - \\n\\uf0b7 Mode of formation  \\n\\uf0b7 Position of the state  \\n\\uf0b7 Citizenship  \\n\\uf0b7 Residuary power  \\n\\uf0b7 The lengthiest Constitution in the world.  \\n ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

It means that no man is above the law and that every person, \\nwhatever be his rank or conditions, is subjec t to the jurisdiction of ordinary courts. “Dicey \\nthe Rule of Law has three distinct meaning “  \\n(1) Supremacy of the law  \\n(2) Equality before the flaw  \\n(3) The Constitution is the result of the ordinary law of the land.  \\n(2) Equal Protection of the Laws  – \\nThis concept is taken from American constitution. This has be en interpreted to mean \\nsubjection to equal law, applying to all in the same circumstances.  It only means that all \\npersons similarly circumstance shall be treated alike both in the privileges con ferred and \\nliabilities imposed by the law equal law should be applied to all in the same situation and \\nthere should be no discrimination between on e person and another. The words “any \\nperson”  in Art 14 of the constitution denotes that the guarantee of the equal protection of \\nlaws is available to any person which includes any company or association or body of \\nindividuals.  The protection of Art 14 extends to both citizens and non -citizens and to natural \\npersons as well as legal persons.  The equality before the law is guaranteed to all without \\nregard to race, colour or nationality. Corporations being juristic persons are also entitled to \\nthe benefit of Art 14.   \\nTest of Reasonable classification  – While Art 14 forbids class legislation;  it permits reasonable \\nclassification  of persons, objects and transactions by the legislature for the purpose of \\nachieving specific ends. But classification must not be arbitrary, artificial or evasive”. It must \\nalways rest upon some real and substantial d istinction bearing a just and reasonable relation \\nto the object sought to be achieved by the legislature, classification to be reasonable must \\nfulfil l the following two conditions – \\n1. the classi fication must be founded on an “intelligible differentia”   which  distinguishes \\npersons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group.  \\n2. the differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the  \\nAct. K.Thimmappa v. Chairman Central Board of Directors SBI  and  Ram Kr ishna Dalmia \\nvs. J. Tandulkar  \\n \\nNew Concept of Equality : Protection against arbitrariness: - In E.P.Royappa v. State  of Tamil \\nNadu   the new concept of equality in the following words  – “Equality is a dynamic concept \\nwith many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be described, Cabined and confined”  \\nwithin traditiona l limits from a positivistic point of view, equality is antithesis to  \\narbitrariness. In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies, one belong to the rule of \\nlaw in a republic while the o ther, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where \\nan act is arbitrary, it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to political logic and  \\nconstitutional law and is therefore violative of Art.14.     \\nExceptions to the equality before la w- Art 361 of the Constitution permits the following \\nexceptions to this rule – \\n\\uf0b7 The President or the Governor of a State shall not be answerable to any court .     \\n\\uf0b7 No criminal proceeding whatsoever shall be instituted or continued against the \\nPresident or a Governor in any court during his term of office.  \\n\\uf0b7 No Civil Proceeding in which relief is claimed against the President or the Governor \\nof a state shall be instituted during his term of office in any Court in respect of any \\nact done or purporting to be done  by him in his personal capacity.

That \\nis why Dr. Ambedk ar called Article 32 as the soul  of the constitution.  \\n Article 32 empowers the S upreme C ourt to act as defender and guarantor of the \\nfundamental right s of the citizen. It has been vested with ‘original and ‘wide’ powers \\nfor that purpose.  The purpose of Art. 32 is to provide a guaranteed, effective, \\nexpeditious, inexpensive and summary remedy for the protection of the \\nfundamental right s. Only the fundamental right can be enforced and not any oth er \\nright like statutory right, customary rights etc. The violation of fundamental right is \\nsine qua non for the applicability of article 32. However, the jurisdiction of the \\nSupreme Court in case of violation fundamental right is concurrent with the \\njurisd iction of the High Court as per Article 226 of the constitution.  It means when \\nthe fundamental right of a citizen is violated, the aggrieved party has the option of \\nmoving either the High Court or Supreme Court directly. Supreme Court and High \\nCourt  ( in c ase of any other right also)  provides the remedy in form of writ which are \\nas follows: - \\n\\uf076 Habea s Corpus : - it is Latin term which literally means ‘to have the body of’ . \\nIt is an order  issued by the court to a person  who has detained another \\nperson to produce  the body of latter before it. The court then examines the \\ncause and legality of the detention. It would set the detained person free, if \\nthe detention is found to be illegal. Thus writ is a bulwark of individual liberty \\nagainst arbitrary detention.  \\nThe wr it of Habeas Corpus can issued against both public and private person . \\nHowever it cannot be issued in following cases: - \\n\\uf0b7 Detention is lawful.  \\n\\uf0b7 Proceeding is for contempt of legislation or a court.  \\n\\uf0b7 Detention is by a competent court.  \\n\\uf0b7 Detention is outside the j urisdiction of the court.  \\n\\uf076 Mandamus : - It literally means ‘we command’.

Such ordinance must be laid before both houses of Parliament and shall \\nhave effect up to six weeks of unless Parliament by disappr oved by resolution.  \\nAn ordinance Promulgated under Art 123 is a law having same force and effect as an \\nAct at Parliament.  The ordinance passed by the President cannot be inquired into \\nchallenged in Courts.  It can not violate fundamental rights.    \\nTRADE,  COMMERCE AND INTERCOURSE  – \\nMeaning: - The word “trade”  means “buying” or “selling” of goods while the term “Commerce”  \\nincludes all forms of transportation such as by land, air or water. The term “intercourse”  means  \\nmovement of goods from one pla ce to anot her place. The words trade commerce and \\nintercourse covers all kinds of activities which are likely to come under the nature of commerce.  \\nIt is to be noted that Art.19 (1) (g) also guarantees to citizens the right to practice any profession \\nor carry on an y trade, business, etc.  But while Art, 19 (1) (g) confers a fundamental right on \\ncitizens to carry on trade, business etc. Art.301 confers only a statutory right. The right under \\nArt. 19 (1) (g) can only be claimed by citizens, but the right under Art.301  can be claimed by any \\none.  \\nThe word “ free” in Art.301 – does not mean freedom from Laws or regulations. There is a clear \\ndistinction between laws interfering with freed om to carry out the activities constituting trade \\nand law imposing rules of proper con duct o r other restraints for the due and orderly manner of \\ncarrying out the activities. The distinction is known as regulations.  \\nThe word “regulation”  has no fixed connotation. Its meaning differs according to the nature of \\nthe thing which it is applied.  A purely regulatory and compensatory law cannot be regarded \\nas violative of the freedom of trade and commerce. Such laws are intended merely to \\nregulate trade and commerce they tend, to facilitate, and not restrict or restrain freedom or \\ntrade. Thus, such  measures as traffic regulations, licensing of vehicles, charging for the \\nmaintenance of roads, marketing and health regulations, price control, economic and social \\nplanning prescribing minimum wages are purely regulatory measures., than a law which \\nlevies  a tax or toll for the use of a road or bridge is  not a barrier or burden on a trade but in \\nreality helps the free -flow of trade by enabling the provision of a mare convenient and less \\nexpensive route. Such compensatory taxes are no hindrance to any such freedom of trade so \\nlong as they are within reasonable limits, if the amount of such taxes are unduly high it \\ncertainly would hamper trade.  \\n   In this connection the Court has pointed ou t that the distinction between “freedom”  in Art 301 \\nand “ restriction ” in Art. 302 and 304 must be kept in mind, and that which, in reality \\nfacilitates trade cannot be a restriction. While that which actually hampers trade will be a  \\nrestriction.

Art.301 assures freedom of inter -State as well as intra -State trade, Commerce and \\nintercourse.  \\n2. Trade, Commerce and intercourse have the widest connotation and take in mo vement \\nof goods and persons.  \\n3. The freedom is not only from laws enacted in the exercise of the powers conferred by \\nthe legislative entries relating to trade and commerce or production, supply and \\ndistribution of goods, but also to all laws including tax la ws. only those laws whose \\ndirect and immediate effect to inhibit or restrict freedom of trade or commerce will \\ncome with the mischief of Art.301. Laws which are merely regulatory or which impose \\npurely compensatory taxes, and hence intended to facilitate f reedom of trade, are \\noutside the scope Art. 301.  \\n4. Restrictions on Trade and Commerce – Art 301 is subject to the restrictions imposed  \\nunder Art. 302 to 305.  \\n\\uf0b7 Parliament’ s Power to regulate trade and commerce in the Public interest  – Art 302 \\nauthorizes Pa rliament to impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce or \\ninter course between one State and another or within any part of the territory of India \\nas may be required in the public interest.  \\n\\uf0b7 State‟s power to regulate trade and commerce – Art 304 (a) empowers the State to \\nimpose any tax on goods imported from other State if similar goods in the State are \\nsubject to similar tax so as not to discriminate between goods so imported and goods \\nmanufactured or produced in the State.  \\n\\uf0b7 Saving of existi ng laws  – Art 305 saves existing laws and laws providing for State \\nmonopolies in so far as the President may by order otherwise direct. In  Saghir Ahmad v.  \\nState of U.P . The Supreme Court raised the question whether an Act providing for State \\nmonopoly in a particular trade or business conflicts with the freedom of trade and \\ncommerce, guaranteed by Art. 301, but left the question undecided. Art 19 was \\namended by the Consti tution (first Amendment) Act in order to take out such State \\nmonopolies out of the purview of Art. 19 (1)(g). But no corresponding provision was \\nadded to Art 305.  \\n\\uf0b7 It appears from the judgement of the Supreme Court that in spite of such an \\namendment a law introducing such State monopoly might have to be justified before the  \\ncourts as being “in the public interest”   or as amounting to a “reasonable” under Art.306 \\n(b) of the Constitution.
